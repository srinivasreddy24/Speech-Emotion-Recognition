As human speech is amongst the most natural way to express ourselves. We depend so much on it that we recognise its importance when resorting to other communication forms like emails and text messages where we often use emojis to express the emotions associated with the messages. As emotions play a vital role in communication, the detection and analysis of the same is of vital importance in todayâ€™s digital world of remote communication. Emotion detection is a challenging task, because emotions are subjective. There is no common consensus on how to measure them. We define a SER system as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect emotions embedded in them.
